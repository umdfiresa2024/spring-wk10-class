The goal of this assignment is to review basic R functions that was taught and review the dataframe that was created to answer each team's research question.

In Week 3's class, each student will work on each step using data from "Defensive Investments and the Impact on Air Quality by Deschenes et al. (2017).

In the lab, each student will make a copy of this document in their team's GitHub repository. Afterward, the team will modify the document to include the dataframe that was developed in the Spring semester.

Step 1. Install necessary packages.

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("kableExtra")
```

Step 2. Declare that you will use these packages in this session.

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
library("kableExtra")
```

Step 3. Upload the dataframe that you have created in Spring 2024 into the repository.

Step 4. Open the dataframe into the RStudio Environment.

```{r}
df<-read.csv("data.csv")
```

Step 5. Use the **head** and **kable** function showcase the first 10 rows of the dataframe to the reader.

```{r}
kable(head(df))
```

## Question 1: What is the frequency of this data frame?

Answer:

## Question 2: What is the cross-sectional (geographical) unit of this data frame?

Answer:

Step 6. Use the **names** function to display all the variables (column) in the dataframe.

```{r}
names(df)
```

In Week 3's class, you will answer each question below based on the research question "How does the NOx Budget Program impact each county's NOx emissions each season?"

In Week 3's lab, you will modify this document to fit your team's research question.

## Question 3: Which column represents the treatment variable of interest?

Answer:

## Question 4: Which column represents the outcome variable of interest?

Answer:

Step 7: Create a boxplot to visualize the distribution of the outcome variable under treatment and no treatment.

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=nox_emit)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~nbp)
```

Step 8: Fit a regression model $y=\beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$ where $y$ is the outcome variable and $x$ is the treatment variable. Use the **summary** function to display the results.

```{r}
model1<-lm(nox_emit ~ nbp, data=df)

summary(model1)
```

## Question 5: What is the predicted value of the outcome variable when treatment=0?

Answer:

## Question 6: What is predicted value of the outcome variable when treatment=1?

Answer:

Step 9: Change the document format to gfm

Step 10: Save this document as README.qmd

Step 11: Render the document. README.md file should be created after this process.

Step 12: Push the document back to GitHub and observe your beautiful document in your repository!

Step 13: If your team has a complete dataframe that includes both the treated and outcome variable, you are done with the assignment. If not, make a research plan in Notion to collect data on the outcome and treatment variable and combine it into one dataframe.
